UBP is a unified, cross‑chain byte interpretation protocol designed to
standardize the way raw blockchain data---addresses, transactions,
bytecode, logs, account states---is decoded and understood across
completely different ecosystems. By removing the dependency on
chain‑specific explorers and tooling, UBP introduces a universal model
for data readability.
