## 🔗 What is UBP?

UBP (Universal Blockchain Protocol) is a simple, readable, chain-agnostic link format for referencing blockchain transactions, wallet addresses, tokens, and blocks.

UBP is designed to become the **“URL format” for blockchains**, similar to how `https://` unified the web.

## 🚀 Why UBP Exists

Every blockchain uses different explorers and link structures.  
Chaotic. Confusing. Fragmented.

UBP fixes this by creating **one universal format** that works across all chains.
